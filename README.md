ODINBOOK

This is the final project for the Rails section of The Odin Project
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project)

This project doesn't focus on stying, just the back end.

In this project I modeled Users, Posts, Comments, Likes, Friend Requests, and Friendships. Assosciated all of the models, and created all the views/controllers to display the information.

I generated a mailer to welcome a new user.

I used Omniauth to allow someone to signup for the app using existing Facebook credentials.

I also used Active Storage to attach an avatar photo.
